    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I hail from Waterbury, Connecticut also known as the Brass City where I spent much of my time gaming with my close pals
        and writing creatively until I graduated from Waterbury Arts Magnet School (WAMS) in June of 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to moving to New York with my mother, I was incredibly unmotivated to do anything
        with my life because I did not see much opportunity for growth within my environment in Waterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the living conditions where much more cramped, I flourished in the
        urban center of Ridgewood in Queens as my mother served as a critical role model 
        for me. She has an incredible work ethic that inspired me to start working towards
        what I desired in life. While I don't know exactly what that is yet, I still find plenty of enjoyment
        working in various industries from retail, IT, and academic research, something I would've never known if not
        for my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was primiarly interested in mathematics where
         I first attended college at the New York City College of Technology.
        However, I realized that in the long run, Computer Science would give me more
        creative freedom in problem solving and as a result, I switched over to Computer Science before heading to 
        the University of Michigan.
