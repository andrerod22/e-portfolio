    <p>
        My name is Andre Rodriguez, and I am a junior currently working towards my B.S in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.engin.umich.edu/">The University of Michigan's Engineering School.</a>
        Currently I am working on several projects improving my skills in problem-solving through C++, Python, and web design with HTML,CSS, and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a site I am constantly building with both personal and school projects.
        <strong>The website itself is a project of its own!</strong>
        Feel free to explore this site and check out my growing list of projects :)
